# Methylphenidate and Cognitive Performance

## Introduction
This project investigates the effects of Methylphenidate (MP) on brain state dynamics and cognitive performance. The study utilizes a multimodal neuroimaging approach, combining positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and behavioral tests to explore the relationship between dopamine signaling, brain activity, and cognition.

## Overview
Methylphenidate (MP) is a stimulant medication widely used for treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This research aims to understand how MP influences brain states to enhance cognitive performance.

## Methods
- **Participants**: 37 healthy adults participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
- **Imaging Techniques**: PET scans measured D1 and D2 dopamine receptor availability, while fMRI captured brain activity before and after MP administration.
- **Behavioral Tests**: Visual attention tasks assessed the cognitive impact of MP.

## Key Findings
- MP primarily affected frontoparietal-dominant activated (FPN+), somatomotor-dominant activated (SOM+), and visual-dominant suppressed (VIS-) brain states.
- Increased dwell time and fractional occupancy in FPN+ and VIS- were associated with improved cognitive performance in low-effort tasks.
- Correlations were found between brain state changes and baseline striatal D1 dopamine receptor availability.

## Conclusion
The study suggests that MP enhances cognitive performance by modifying brain states, particularly through dopamine D1 receptor signaling. This project provides insights into the mechanisms behind MP's cognitive effects, with potential implications for personalized medicine in ADHD treatment.
